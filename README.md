# OT(R)S
WIP Tibia 7.6 server with basic functionality written in rust.
### Currently supports:
    - reading OTB map files
    - reading OTB item files
    - logging in/out
    - jank player movement

## Running
To run this you will need to source an items.otb file, you can find in other open source servers on github.
To connect to the server you will need a client, I recommend [otclient](https://github.com/mehah/otclient/tree/main) which is an open source implementation of tibia client. You will find instructions on setting up the clien in their repo
